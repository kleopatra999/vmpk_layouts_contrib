Since keyboard layouts are not protected by copyright, and these files are essentially mechanical translations into a format readable by VMPK, I believe they are neither protected by copyright. However, in case I am mistaken, I (Mechanical snail) waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights I may have in this work, to the fullest extent possible under law, according to the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Other terms may apply for layouts contributed by others; see the header comments of those files.
